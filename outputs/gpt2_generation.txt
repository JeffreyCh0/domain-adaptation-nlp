0: Fever's the fuse we'll burn forever
We're gonna burn forever
And I believe the flames
Will burn forever
I believe in our love we'll rise to power
We'll rise to power
The fuse is gonna burn forever
We're gonna burn forever
We'll burn forever
And I believe the flames will burn forever
And I believe in our love we'll rise to power
We'll rise to power
Burn!
Burn!
And I believe the flames will burn forever
We're gonna burn forever
We're gonna burn forever
We're gonna burn forever
And I believe the flames will burn forever
And I believe the flames will burn forever
Burn!


1: They never seemed to mind
We didn't think 'bout when
They needed something
But I'm tired of talking too fast
My brain just can't handle it
I've got tendencies
That I can't categorize
Until it's gone
They didn't notice
We didn't think 'bout what we was doing
Never had the time to think
How to act
How to get over me
When I don't know what to do
Never felt so out of place
Never had the time
And it's too bad I haven't seen you
I've got tendencies
That I can't categorize
Until it's gone
They didn't notice
We didn't think 'bout what we was doing
Never had the time
And it's too bad I haven't seen you
I've got tendencies
That I can't categorize
Until it's gone
They didn't notice
We didn't think 'bout what we were doing
Never had the time
And it's too bad I haven't seen you
I've got tendencies
That I can't categorize
Until it's gone

3: A wild and wild
Two lovers are on the run
Two lovers, two lovers, one
Two lovers with only one
And no one seems to care
All alone
All alone
Oh no
The road you've walked
It gets dark
And you start to feel
The only light is out
You start to feel
The only light is out
'Cause there's nobody
There's nobody
A wild and wild
Two lovers, two lovers
They say that I'm not lonely
They say that it's only me and you
But, well
Two lovers, two lovers, one
Two lovers with only one
And no one seems to care
All alone
All alone
There's nobody there
No, no
The road you've walked
It gets dark
And you start to feel
The only light is out
You start to feel
The only light is out

5: (Martin Plaza/Jeff Trott)
Now I'm in town tonight
Now I'm in town tonight
I got a message
From the president of the United Nations (Chriss America/Jeff Trott).
Hey man, they're standing up straight
'Cause what you say when you're with me,
Is not going to change no more
(Chevy Cartagena/Don Cartagena/Don Cartagena)
If I don't get you back,
I'ma tell you that I won't be back (chevy Cartagena)
'Cause your hands are tied and your feet are bound,
You got a big prick and you don't need no hand to grab my ass
Oh no, you don't think that you'd be free
Well if you think you really think you like me
It's funny how you can be as right and wrong as me.
(Chevy Cartagena/Don Cartagena/Don Cartagena)
Now everybody knows
We live in a bubble
If you live in that bubble you'll feel free to fly
Everybody knows, you're free to move or you may choose to stay.
Now everybody knows
We live in a bubble
If you live in that bubble you'll feel free to fly
Everybody knows, you're free to move or you may choose to stay.
Yeah, we do! (Chevy Cartagena/Don


6: We'll have sex every now and then, tonight
We'll touch every skin and make everything okay
We'll make love every now and then, tonight
We'll have sex every now and then, tonight
I know you'll be dreaming
But baby, you never come true
I love you, it's the only thing that connects me
To you
But baby, you never come true
You're so misunderstood
I don't want to know
But baby, you never come true
I'll tell you my truth
But baby, you never come true
Don't you know, baby, just what I am
Don't you know you're beautiful
You're beautiful
You're beautiful
You're beautiful
Let's give each other love
Let's give each other love
Let's give each other love
Let's give each other love
Let's give each other love
Give each other love
Don't you know, baby, just what I am
Don't you know you're beautiful
You're beautiful
You're beautiful
You're beautiful
Let's give each other love
Let's give each other love
Let's give each other love


7: Now I stand at the feet of a broken heart
As I wait for my chance
To say I'll do all I can
To show the world that I have met my untimely end
Now I sit alone by a suicide note
Like a prisoner to the death of a love that I once knew
The man inside, is gone
Now I sit alone by a suicide note
Like a prisoner to the death of a love that I once knew
The man inside, is gone


8: I walked through the gates gates
And there I caught a glimpse
From the far wall of time
I saw the light
And through the crack in the wall
I found
The way the light splits through
The silence that surrounded me
Stilled was the cold
I watched the world
As it passed me by
I viewed this
The damage done
And I saw a door that leads
And in that door
Inside I saw
The sun on a distant horizon
And it came the second that I
Went into the light
And through it
I found
The way the light splits through
The silence that surrounded me
Stilled was the cold
I watched the world
As it passed me by
I viewed this
The damage done
And I saw a door that leads
And in that door
Inside I saw
The sun on a distant horizon
And it came the second that I
Went into the light
And through it
I found
